# Chronos

Chronos is a volume-LFO tool that seamlessly blends BPM-synchronized timing with free-running Hz mode to let producers perform in-time stutter manipulation. Using the bpm/hz mode artists can speed up or slow down the stutter rate in Hz and then snap perfectly back to the grid-locked BPM mode without going off beat. The goal is to give producers control over stutter timing while always maintaining tempo allignment.
